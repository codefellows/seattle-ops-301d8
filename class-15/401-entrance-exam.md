Welcome to the 401 Entrance Exam. Please read these instructions carefully.

- A score of 80% or higher is required to pass the exam. 
- This is an individual test: you may NOT collaborate with others.
- As you prepare to take this test, study all of the Ops 301 topics, but do not expect the exam to be limited to items we directly covered in class.
  - This exam expects you to take the concepts, frameworks, and problem solving skills you've learned in 301 and apply them to problems which may be entirely new to you, but are similar to situations you have already encountered.
- You are not expected to solve these challenges just by looking over the choices.
- This test is open book and you are expected to use your professional tools and problem-solving skills to empirically find the answers.
  - You are **NOT** permitted to use AI tools such as ChatGPT.
- If a question involves code, take time to work with the code in an appropriate development environment. 

Be thoughtful, and have fun with it!
