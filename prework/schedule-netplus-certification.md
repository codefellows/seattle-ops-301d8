The curriculum of Ops 301 is aligned to the [learning objectives](https://www.comptia.org/training/resources/exam-objectives){:target="_blank"} of the CompTIA Network+ certification. Earning this certification demonstrates foundational knowledge of computer operations and support. **For this assignment, you'll schedule your CompTIA Network+ exam to be taken at the end of the course.**

> If for some reason you cannot schedule your exam before the end of your course, discuss an alternative with your instructor.

## Objectives

- Schedule your CompTIA Network+ exam for a date prior to demo day

## Tasks

- Access the [Pearson Vue test scheduling website](https://home.pearsonvue.com/Clients/CompTIA.aspx){:target="_blank"}. Note that this site is for CompTIA testing specifically. If you have never scheduled a CompTIA exam through Pearson Vue, you'll need to [create an account](https://wsr.pearsonvue.com/testtaker/profile/create/SignUp.htm?clientCode=COMPTIA&locale=en_US){:target="_blank"} first.
- Sign in and schedule the CompTIA Network+ with either a testing center or virtually from home. Ensure that you schedule your exam for a date prior to the final day of class, which is project demo day.
- Once you have scheduled your exam, take a screenshot of your exam appointment date and time. Paste this into your Google Doc. Explain how you will use the study guide to prepare you for the exam (hint: find the practice tests!).

At the end of this course, you will submit your final score on the Network+ exam and it will be weighted towards your course grade.
