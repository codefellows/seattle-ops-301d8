# Network Scanning with NMAP

## Overview

The network mapping tool Nmap is an open source, command line utility commonly used in network discovery ("enumeration" in offensive terms), security auditing, and pentesting. Nmap can audit whether ports are open or closed on a target host.

Today you will perform a series of basic scanning operations using Nmap and learning more about network ports and protocols.
